this is a small project to automate ms17_010 metasploit exploit.
clone it on your home directory in kali
dependent on:
1. Metasploit
2. Nmap
3. arp-scan
run ./start.sh from ms17_010 directory
NOTE: edit the interface for arp-scan in start.sh
check the report generated in data and report directory

CAUTION:The code is still buggy, exploits dosent work always, currently it works for windows 7 x64 architecture , needs eternalblue exploit from elevenpaths
